## üß† Core Concepts & Design Philosophy

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### IndexedDB-First Storage

The core design principle of Cine-Mon is privacy and data ownership. All user data (movies, collections, profile settings) is stored directly in the browser's **IndexedDB**.
=======
### Local-First Storage

The core design principle of Cine-Mon is privacy and data ownership. All user data (movies, collections, profile settings) is stored directly in the browser's **`localStorage`**.

-   **Pros**:
    -   **Zero-Login**: No accounts or sign-ups required.
    -   **Blazing Fast**: Data access is instantaneous.
    -   **Offline Functionality**: The entire app works without an internet connection (except for fetching new data from TMDB).
    -   **Ultimate Privacy**: No personal data is ever sent to a remote server.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    -   **Larger Storage Capacity**: IndexedDB can handle much larger datasets than localStorage.
    -   **Structured Data**: Better support for complex data structures and queries.
=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
-   **Cons/Trade-offs**:
    -   Data is tied to a specific browser on a specific device. It does not sync automatically.
    -   Clearing browser data will erase your Cine-Mon library. **Use the Export feature to create regular backups!**

### Dynamic Changelog

A notable challenge during development was ensuring the in-app changelog displayed the latest updates from `CHANGELOG.md` after a new release. Initially, Next.js would cache a static version of the page at build time. This was fixed by marking the changelog pages as fully dynamic (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`), forcing them to re-read the file on every request.

## üöÄ Coming Soon

The cinematic universe is always expanding. Here are some of the features on the roadmap:

-   **Smart Notifications**: Optional alerts for upcoming releases from your watchlist.
-   **Advanced AI Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on your unique watch history and ratings.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
-   **More Customisation**: Additional themes and layout options.
-   **Cloud Backup & Restore**: An *optional* feature to sync your data across devices using a service like Firebase.
