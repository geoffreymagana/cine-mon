# üé¨ Cine-Mon: Your Cinematic Companion

**Cine-Mon** is more than just a watchlist; it's a beautifully designed, offline-first personal vault for your entire cinematic life. Built for viewers who don‚Äôt just watch, but *live inside the story*, it allows you to archive what you‚Äôve watched, plan what‚Äôs next, and relive what you loved‚Äîon your own terms.

This project was developed to be a private, powerful, and deeply personal media journal, not just another tracking app.

### ‚ú® Introducing the Canvas: Your Visual Storyboard (Desktop Only)

The Canvas is a powerful, free-form space designed for visual thinkers, storytellers, and obsessive organizers. Go beyond lists and create rich, interconnected maps of your cinematic world.

**Inventive Use Cases:**
-   **Franchise Timelines:** Visually map the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe or the convoluted timelines of the X-Men series.
-   **Character Webs:** Connect characters to the films they appear in, and draw lines to represent their relationships, rivalries, and alliances.
-   **Thematic Moodboards:** Group films by aesthetic, director's style, or common themes like "Mind-Bending Sci-Fi" or "Cozy Autumn Movies."
-   **Writer's Room:** Use cards for scenes, characters, and plot points. Connect them to outline your next screenplay.

**How to Use:**
1.  Navigate to the **Canvas** from the sidebar (on desktop).
2.  Press **`Cmd/Ctrl + K`** to open the command palette for all actions.
3.  **Add nodes** by importing movies from your collection or creating new text cards.
4.  **Connect nodes** by dragging from the handles on the sides of each card.
5.  **Split connections** by dragging an existing node over an edge line.

## üß† Core Concepts & Technical Insights

This section sheds light on some of the interesting challenges and design decisions made during the development of Cine-Mon.

#### IndexedDB-First Storage
The core design principle of Cine-Mon is privacy and data ownership. All user data (movies, collections, profile settings) is stored directly in the browser's **IndexedDB**.

-   **Pros**: Zero-Login, blazing fast, fully offline, and ultimate privacy.
-   **Cons/Trade-offs**: Data is tied to a specific browser on a specific device. **Use the Export feature to create regular backups!**

#### Challenge: Building an Interactive Canvas
Implementing the Canvas feature introduced several technical hurdles, particularly with edge intersection.
-   **The Problem:** The initial approach to detect when a dragged node was over an edge relied on fragile DOM element detection (`elementsFromPoint`), which failed inconsistently. Furthermore, the logic for splitting the edge was incorrect, causing connections to break.
-   **The Solution:** The feature was rebuilt using a more robust geometric calculation to determine the distance between a node and an edge line. The edge-splitting logic in `onNodeDragStop` was completely rewritten to correctly re-assign the `source` and `target` of the newly created edges, ensuring a seamless split.

#### Critical Fix: Hydrating Component State
A persistent bug caused the app to crash when interacting with a reloaded canvas. The root cause was that function props on nodes (like `onTitleChange`) were not being correctly serialized to `localStorage`. The fix involved re-hydrating the nodes with the necessary functions every time a canvas is loaded, restoring interactivity.

#### Feature Philosophy: Command Palette (`Cmd+K`)
To create a fluid, power-user experience, a command palette was introduced, inspired by tools like Obsidian and VS Code. This consolidated scattered UI actions (add node, save, zoom) into a single, searchable interface, reducing UI clutter and empowering users to perform actions without leaving the keyboard.

#### UI/UX: Component Reuse on the Canvas
To maintain visual consistency, the canvas doesn't use a separate, simplified card. Instead, it embeds the application's main `MovieCard` component directly inside a `CustomNode`. The `CustomNode` acts as a "window frame," providing canvas-specific functionality (resize handles, connection ports), while the `MovieCard` provides the rich, familiar content view.

## üöÄ Coming Soon

The cinematic universe is always expanding. Here are some of the features on the roadmap:
-   **Smart Notifications**: Optional alerts for upcoming releases from your watchlist.
-   **Advanced AI Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on your unique watch history and ratings.
-   **More Customization**: Additional themes and layout options.
-   **Cloud Backup & Restore**: An *optional* feature to sync your data across devices using a service like Firebase.
