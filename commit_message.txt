feat(canvas): Introduce interactive Canvas for visual organization (Desktop Only)

This major feature introduces the "Canvas," a free-form, infinite space for users to visually organize their cinematic universe, inspired by tools like Obsidian.

- feat(canvas): Create new canvas pages with React Flow for node-based editing.
- feat(canvas): Support adding text cards and importing movies from the user's collection as nodes.
- feat(canvas): Implement node connections with customizable edge types and colors.
- feat(canvas): Add edge intersection, allowing users to drop a node onto an edge to automatically split the connection.
- feat(ui): Introduce a powerful command palette (Cmd+K) that centralizes all canvas actions (add node, save, zoom), replacing multiple UI toolbars for a cleaner, keyboard-first experience.
- feat(ui): Implement context-aware keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Backspace` to delete selected items).

fix(canvas): Resolve multiple bugs related to canvas stability and functionality

- fix(canvas): Correct the edge-splitting logic in `onNodeDragStop` to ensure connections are properly re-assigned.
- fix(canvas): Stabilize edge intersection by replacing fragile DOM element detection (`elementsFromPoint`) with a more robust geometric calculation and `.closest()`.
- fix(state): Fix critical hydration bug where function props on nodes (e.g., `onTitleChange`) were not being restored from `localStorage`, causing the app to crash on reloaded canvases.
- fix(build): Resolve multiple build and runtime errors, including incorrect `'use client'` directive placement, missing `cmdk` dependency, and deprecated React Flow API usage.

docs(readme): Overhaul documentation to reflect new features and attributions

- docs(readme): Add a new "Canvas" section to the README, detailing its desktop-only nature, use cases (timelines, character webs), and command palette usage.
- docs(readme): Add a "Technical Insights" section detailing development challenges and solutions, like the edge intersection implementation and the state hydration fix.
- docs(readme): Add full licensing and attribution for TMDB, React Flow (MIT), and Lucide Icons (ISC).
- docs(guide): Update the in-app "Getting Started Guide" with a new section explaining how to use the Canvas.

chore(ui): Consolidate scattered canvas UI controls into the command palette for a cleaner and more focused editing experience.
