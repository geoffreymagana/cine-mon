feat(ui): Introduce Multi-Select, Bulk Actions, and major UI/UX refinements

This release introduces a powerful multi-select feature for managing collections, alongside significant UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes to improve usability and visual polish across the app.

### ✨ New Features

#### Multi-Select & Bulk Actions

-   **Selection Mode**: Users can now enter a "selection mode" from the dashboard header to select multiple movie or show cards at once.
-   **Contextual Header**: When one or more items are selected, a new contextual header appears, showing the number of selected items and providing new bulk action buttons.
-   **Bulk Delete**: Users can now delete multiple items from their collection simultaneously, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental data loss.
-   **Add to Collection (Foundation)**: The UI for adding multiple selected items to a Vault or Spotlight is now in place, ready for future implementation.

### 🎨 UI & UX Enhancements

-   **Personalized Dashboard Title**: The dashboard header is now personalized, displaying "[User]'s Collection" for a more custom feel. The font size has also been refined for a cleaner look.
-   **Responsive Search Dialog**: The TMDB search dialog has been redesigned to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile devices. The layout now adapts gracefully to prevent long titles from hiding the "Import" button.
-   **Improved "Fork on GitHub" Button**: The secondary call-to-action buttons on the landing page now feature a smoother, more engaging "fill from left" hover animation and clearer "Fork on GitHub" text.
-   **Redesigned Changelog Page**: The public changelog page has been redesigned to match the elegant, single-column "reading mode" layout of the "About" page, significantly improving readability.

### ⚙️ Fixes & Under the Hood

-   **Build Error Resolution**: Fixed critical "Module not found" errors that were preventing the dashboard from building correctly.
-   **Theme & Contrast Fix**: Resolved a major bug where the app's light/dark mode theme was incorrectly affecting the text color on public-facing pages (Landing, Changelog, Legal), making text unreadable. These pages now maintain a consistent, high-contrast look.
-   **UI Bug Fixes**:
    -   The contextual header for multi-select actions now has a solid background, fixing a transparency issue.
    -   Corrected a minor layout misalignment in the changelog's timeline view.
