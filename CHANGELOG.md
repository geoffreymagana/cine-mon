## 1.0.0 (2025-06-30)

### Features

*   **release:** Version 1.0.0 - The Cinematic Overhaul

    This commit marks a major milestone for Cine-Mon, introducing a suite of powerful features designed to transform it from a simple tracker into a comprehensive cinematic universe manager. This release focuses on deep personalization, robust organization, and a more immersive user experience.

    #### ✨ New Core Features

    *   **Unified TMDB Search**: Instantly import movies, TV shows, anime, and K-dramas with rich metadata from The Movie Database. The search is now faster and more powerful, with a dedicated dialog.

    *   **Introducing Vaults & Spotlights**: A brand new way to organize your collection.
        *   **Vaults**: Create private, curated collections for your all-time favorites. Manually drag and drop titles to get the perfect order.
        *   **Spotlights**: Build high-priority watchlists, perfect for tracking recommendations from friends or preparing for movie marathons.

    *   **Advanced Status Tracking**: Mark titles as `Watching`, `Completed`, `On-Hold`, `Dropped`, or `Plan to Watch`. Your progress is now clearly visible with new status icons on each movie card.

    *   **Full Data Portability**: Your data is yours. Easily import your entire collection from a JSON file, or export it to JSON or CSV for backup and peace of mind.

    #### 🎨 UI & UX Enhancements

    *   **Centralized Actions**: We've cleaned up the main grid by moving all actions (Add to Collection, Delete) into a "More options" menu on the movie details page for a cleaner, more focused browsing experience.

    *   **Immersive Detail Pages**: Movie detail pages now feature a stunning, blurred backdrop using the title's artwork, creating a cinematic atmosphere.

    *   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Effortlessly reorder your main collection view by simply dragging and dropping posters into your preferred sequence.

    *   **Embedded Trailer Player**: Watch trailers directly within the app in a beautiful, ambient player without leaving the page.

    #### 🤓 For the Cinephile Geeks

    *   **Script Archiving**: Upload and attach script files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) directly to a movie entry. Perfect for writers, students, and analysts.

    *   **Deeper Analytics**: The "Geek Out" section of your analytics now tracks more metrics, giving you even deeper insights into your watch habits.

    #### ⚙️ Under the Hood

    *   **Persistent Theming**: Your selected theme color and dark/light mode preferences are now saved and persist across browser sessions.
    *   **Robust Local Storage**: All your data—from movies to collections and profile settings—is now reliably saved to your browser's local storage.
