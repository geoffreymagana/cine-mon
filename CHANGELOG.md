*   **Introducing Vaults & Spotlights**: A brand new way to organize your collection.
    *   **Vaults**: Create private, curated collections for your all-time favorites. Manually drag and drop titles to get the perfect order.
    *   **Spotlights**: Build high-priority watchlists, perfect for tracking recommendations from friends or preparing for movie marathons.

*   **Advanced Status Tracking**: Mark titles as `Watching`, `Completed`, `On-Hold`, `Dropped`, or `Plan to Watch`. Your progress is now clearly visible with new status icons on each movie card.

*   **Full Data Portability**: Your data is yours. Easily import your entire collection from a JSON file, or export it to JSON or CSV for backup and peace of mind.

### üé® UI & UX Enhancements

*   **Immersive Detail Pages**: Movie detail pages now feature a stunning, blurred backdrop using the title's artwork, creating a cinematic atmosphere.

*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Effortlessly reorder your main collection view by simply dragging and dropping posters into your preferred sequence.

*   **Embedded Trailer Player**: Watch trailers directly within the app in a beautiful, ambient player without leaving the page.
